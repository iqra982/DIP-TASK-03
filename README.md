Task 3
Develop a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform image enhancement techniques on a given input image. The program should read and display the original color image, convert it to YCrCb color space, and apply histogram equalization on the luminance (Y) channel using the built-in OpenCV function.
